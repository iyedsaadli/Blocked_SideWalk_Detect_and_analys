166079,Blocked Sidewalk,"Hello,

I am writing to make a complaint about the scooters that have appeared over the last few weeks from both Bird and Lime. This past Saturday, multiple scooters from both companies were simply abandoned in Bryan Park, some of which were blocking the sidewalks and paths through the park, some of which were leaning against trees and benches, all of which were eyesores in an otherwise lovely park. At one point in the afternoon, six or so Lime scooters were dropped off on the sidewalk by the Henderson St. lower parking lot by folks from Enterprise Rental, on the sidewalk, where people walk, run, etc.

In Bloomington, we are fortunate to have bike racks everywhere. Would it be possible to require that users and companies place the scooters at bike rack locations? By simply allowing them to be left wherever, users are leaving them around without regard to others. 

This is also a bit of an issue with the Pace bikes. A few weeks ago, one was left leaning on the stop sign at Henderson and Davis, when there is a bike rack just a block away in the park. 

Thank you for taking steps to regulate these companies in a manner that benefits everyone.

I have seen this particular vehicle parked on the path a number of times since the house was built adjacent to the path. Considering your suggestion from the previous incident, I have attached a photo of the offending vehicle. From the license plate, the operator appears to be connected with law enforcement (license plate LE8928). I find this very disturbing that an individual who should be setting an example for the community is using a pedestrian path for convenience. I would like to point out that I occasionally ride my bicycle on this path and have observed pedestrians on it as well. Also, there is plenty of street parking in this part of the neighborhood in front of the houses, i.e., I don't see lack of available parking as an excuse.

Each and every single day, I notice children waiting for the bus, standing on the street exposed to traffic coming both directions. And what's more, this is a main thoroughfare for the entire neighborhood as it runs right up to the main West entrance to Bryan Park, which is the location of the main playgrounds. I see children walking down this street every day to access the playgrounds and it is undeniably an unsafe street given that cars are parked on both sides and traffic is traveling both ways.

As you may know the neighborhood of Blue Ridge is bounded by College Ave on the West, Dunn Street on the East, and Old State Road 37 (and, in part, the Cascades trail) on the North. While Blue Ridge has many positive aspect, unfortunately walkability and biking accessibility to the rest of Bloomington is not one. Dunn Street is narrow, with low visibility hampered by hills, and College Avenue has high-speed traffic. Bloomington Mass Transit does not serve our neighborhood. These factors combine to make walking or biking into or out of Blue Ridge a challenge. It would be of great benefit to our neighborhood if some means could be found to connect our neighborhood via sidewalks to the rest of Bloomington and give our 220 households a means to safely access Bloomington other than by car.

With that goal in mind, we request consideration of a sidewalk on North Dunn Street connecting SR 45/46 to Tamarack and ultimately Lakewood Drive.

153534,Sidewalk Requests,"I am a pedestrian who commutes to work about 1.3 miles northbound on Wooodlawn Monday-Friday. Usually I scurry quickly up that street as I'm running late; sometimes I jog. But once I get to the part of Woodlawn that borders Bryan Park, I am loathe to get myself onto the park trail during my hasty commute for a few reasons:

1. The Bryan Park trail is a park trail, not a sidewalk.

2. This trail doesn't go straight northward, so it is a waste of my time to follow it.

3. My commute is at 7:15am when few people are out, making things unnecessarily scary for trail users when I'm quickly approaching them from behind. This is especially true during colder months when it is dark out, and also when I'm carrying my umbrella, which looks not unlike some sort of a weapon. (Its just an Ikea umbrella.)

This morning I was yelled at for the second time by another motorist who was displeased with my choosing to walk on Woodlawn Avenue northbound past Bryan Park. ""There's a sidewalk over there!"" he shouted. I had wanted to correct him and point out that its a park trail, but I didn't. Who knows which maniac who shouts at pedestrians from their car isn't more dangerous, you know?

It would be great if there were a sidewalk that ran alongside Woodlawn Avenue past Bryan Park. I'm not the only person who chooses to walk up the road instead of the park trail, but I admit that there are not many of us, at least at 7:15am.

Let me end by saying that I am not holding out hope for a sidewalk; this probably isn't a great concern for the city. But I can't guarantee that annoyed motorists will convince me to change my path, either.

In any case: thank you for reading and considering my request. Have a nice day.

158244,Sidewalk Requests,"Hello, my name is John Kelly and I am the senior bar manager at Kilroys Sports Bar in Bloomington, Indiana. I apologize if i am sending this request to the wrong department. Essentially, we wanted to get in contact with the city regarding the parking out front of our building during late night hours (11pm-3am). Our hope is that we could put in a request to have those spots blocked off during those times during the school semesters. The reason for this is due to safety. With more and more students being picked up and dropped off at the location by ubers, lyfts, etc, cars are constantly coming and going from the location. Our main concern is that when cars are parked in these spots, students attempting to cross the street or make their way to their respective rides are difficult to see for oncoming traffic. If this is at all possible on a semi-permanent basis going forward or even only for temporary large events such as the Little 500 weekend, please contact me at the email listed above and let me know what we need to do in order to make this happen, if possible.

165230,Sidewalk Requests,"Thank you in advance for reading my inquiry. I would like to suggest a sidewalk due to a safety concern that effects children and disabled persons. Referring to the intersection at E Rogers Road and the Stands Drive. There is no sidewalk along this street connecting the stands road sidewalk to the crosswalk at the roundabout at the bottom of the hill (i.e., the area on the south side of E Rogers Road). Moreover, the sidewalk on the other side of the street is completely inaccessible for those with impaired motor function or wheelchairs (there is a large hill with steps only and no ramp). There are two major concerns here: (1) there is no possible way for a disabled person with a wheelchair to travel on E Rogers road (from the roundabout at the bottom of the hill up to the stands drive). (2) There is no way for families and children to safely walk to Child's elementary from this location (the Stands dr). Given that E Rogers road is a busy street with limited visibility for drivers and no crosswalk exists at the intersection of the Stands drive and E Rogers Road, it is extremely dangerous for children and families that wish to walk their children to the designated elementary school - Child's Elementary. This is the only direct walking path to Child's Elementary for all of the constituents that leave in the Stands neighborhood. There is no sidewalk on the south side of E Rogers Rd to connect the Stands Dr with the crosswalk at the bottom of the hill at the roundabout. Several constituents have expressed a safety concern.

I just wonder - couldn't the city work with the construction workers to create a safe place for pedestrians while this construction is going on? I wouldnt' have said anything, but it's been a month and clearly the construction is going to take a few more months.",,N College AVE,Bloomington,IN,,,,POSITIVE

131218,Sidewalk & Curb Complaints,"I would like to bring to your attention the poor walkability of Rockport Rd between W Pinehurst Dr and Graham. This 200 yards' block is the ""missing link"" between the Southern Pines neighborhood (which
has a decent sidewalk network) and the Country View apartment complex, which has the closest city bus stop.

On this block of Rockport Rd, if one is to walk north from W Pinehurst Dr along the west side of Rockport, the sidewalk simply ends in a fence (pictured in the photo attached). I pass there often, and I've seen pedestrians use the road shoulder, which is quite dangerous, what with the narrow street, heavy traffic, and limited visibility (hills). On the east side
of Rockport Rd, there is sidewalk part of the way, but it is not continuous either; besides, crossing the road twice may be dangerous, especially for older people and children, considering what the traffic
and visibility in Rocport Rd is like.

I think it would be highly useful for many residents (and for people who have to drive through there) if some kind of improvement project were undertaken. One ought to either build a sidewalk along the west side of the road, or to complete the sidewalk along the east side and create marked pedestrian crossings at W. Graham and W. Pinehurst (or

I and serveral of my neighoubrs rely on city bus #2 to go to work, and the only bus stop within walking distance is located at Country View Apts. However, there's no convenient way to get to the bus stop from Southern Pines, because there's no side walk on Rockport Rd between Country View Apts and Tapp Road. The road in this section is very narrow, and there's no shoulder next to the lane either. People would have to walk through bushes right next to the road. Plus, Rockport is becoming a rather busy road, with many cars constantly rushing by at a rather fast speed. With the limited visibility due to the the big slopes in this hilly section, it is extremely dangerous for pedestrians even during the day time, not to mention after dark.

The problem with this is that the traffic is very heavy on Clarizz, particularly so close to the intersection with 3rd St and this makes crossing, particularly for someone in a wheelchair, perilous.

158156,Sidewalk & Curb Complaints,"Good afternoon,

I am writing to report an issue with water drainage coming from the roofs of houses and dumping on to the sidewalk. Along N. Indiana Ave, many houses/apartments (owned by Elkins Apartments) have drainage downspouts that empty directly on to the sidewalk. This creates a hazard with constant freeze and thew during the winter months. I have personally felt unsafe walking down a sloped sidewalk, on what is pure ice during periods this winter. Indiana Ave. is a very high foot traffic area during winter months as fans walk to and from basketball games. From witnessing several people slip and fall on the ice, I feel like it is my duty as a citizen to report this issue to the city. Though we have been blessed this season with relatively mild temperatures, this does not overshadow the safety hazard created from the downspouts off many of these houses. This problem would ideally need to be handled quickly before the next cold spell of weather. Thank you.

164136,Sidewalk & Curb Complaints,"Hey, all. I'm at 4021 E. Morningside Drive. Unfortunately I've been experiencing some drainage issues at my corner since the installation of a wheelchair ramp for the sidewalk. There was no issue prior. Terrific having the ramp for folks, plus the earlier sidewalk, but unfortunately it has no lip on it at all. As you can see in the photo, the street is essentially level with part of my yard now, allowing even the smallest rain to flood the corner. I'd love to grow grass but am having difficulties because of the situation. There was grass prior, but someone crashed into the streetlamp, and when it was replaced, the ground got torn up a bit. Beyond my yard, a small pool exists along the corner until it dries out as well, as it is unable to pass on through. Also sediment as you can see in the photo (taken tonight a few hours after the end of today's misting) is washed into the street with each rain. Please see if there can be just the smallest bit of lip and/or incline added with the ramp/sidewalk to keep the water moving instead of creating a muddy corner. Thank you for any help! (Or ideas!) Any chance you all might have a square foot of sod that is fairly water tolerant that can just be placed down there? Might solve my issue without any need for changing anything with the concrete assuming it takes root. I appreciate the consideration and help.

166253,Sidewalk & Curb Complaints,"Follow up on uReport Case #158991:

In spring of 2017 I filed a report with the city about the downspout drainage from my neighbor's property (2802 S Forrester), which dispenses rainwater directly onto the sidewalk in front of my house. They were issued a notice by the city, and they cut back the relevant downspout as indicated in the resolution of the ticket.

However, thereafter they built a masonry channel from the end of the downspout that continues to direct the rainwater from the downspout onto the sidewalk in front of my property. When it rains moderately or heavily, the sidewalk on my property turns into a river, still, and in the seasonal transition to and from winter, the sidewalk winds up coated with ice. They
masonry channel is topped with a plywood cover that is disguised with landscape rocks.

I wanted to talk with them about this directly rather than file a report, but for 3 weeks I have not seen them at their house. Their house is reportedly under contract for sale, and I think it only fair that this issue be resolved (ideally by extending the drainage under the sidewalk to the curb so it no longer causes a negative impact on my property) before they sell it, so that new owners do not have to correct something they are not responsible for.

This is a follow up to ticket #166390, in which Phil Peden indicated he wanted to see it when it rains. This is a view to the west from the sidewalk on the west side of Rogers St at about 9th street, between Bloomington Iron Metal (right of photo) and 501 N Rogers. The two problematic tributaries are labelled in the photo. They meet just to the left of the photo, which is exactly where the sidewalk crosses the 501 N Rogers driveway, and they flow south from there. Tributary A runs eastward along the north side of the pavement there, and then fans out where the pavement seam starts, and poses the larger problem because it is too wide to step over. Tributary B handles a large volume of water, but in light rain you can hop over it onto a manhole cover (marked ""communications"") that is just to the right of the photo. If a trench was dug in the dirt along the north side of the asphalt, extending all the way from the fence to the sidewalk, then A and B could probably be forced to join directly at the photographer's feet.

I ride the bus to work at the Gov. Agency building at 1531 S. Curry Pike, and there most definitely needs to be a sidewalk that continues to wrap around further toward the bus stop so that wheel chairs or folks with other disabilities do not fall into the road. The area is super muddy, and even someone with good balance like me can't walk through it. There is a sidewalk leading through the parking lot, but where the bus drops you off there is no actual sidewalk, and the bus won't drop someone off at the actual sidewalk due to it obstructing the parking lot entrance. All it would take is probably about 20-30 feet of sidewalk right there. There may already be a number of complaints, but I really hope it gets fixed so someone doesn't flip their wheelchair into the road or something.

But I’m now tackling a problem related to the substantial growth in tourism. It initially seemed reasonable to allow tour busses to park on city street in front of hotels, but there a too many days where half of the available parking on the block is taken by busses. Some days,like today, it’s 100% bus parking g without a single parking space available for a visiting family or business guest in the hotel or even a customer for a downtown shop. 
This isn’t normal parking management. It’s not good parking management.
The busses should be parked in a large lot like the convention center or Assembly Hall (IU groups)
I have helped manage a lot of downtown growth issues and this one looks to be easily fixable.

170555,Sidewalk & Curb Complaints,"The photograph of this hole was taken Sept. 27, 2019. The same hole can be found in case #161692 from Oct. 27, 2017. Danna Workman reported that the hole had been repaired, but I can assure you it was not. It is located between 1217 and 1221 N Madison (closer to 1217, and so large as to be observable from satellite photos and Google Street View). Even though I knew it was there, in the dark the other night, I nearly turned an ankle in it. The whole sidewalk along the west side of N. Madison between 16th and 17th is in a terrible state of disrepair and has been the entire time I've lived in this neighborhood. I know that landowners are supposed to maintain the sidewalks, but I also know that it's the city's duty to enforce that rule. What I don't know is why Danna Workman reported that the hole was repaired when it wasn't. In any event, the sidewalk is still a hazard. What are you going to do about it?",Street Department,"1217 N Madison St, Bloomington, Indiana, 47404",Bloomington,IN,,39.17828750610352,-86.53797912597656,NEUTRAL
