I am writing to make a complaint about the scooters that have appeared over the last few weeks from both Bird and Lime. This past Saturday, multiple scooters from both companies were simply abandoned in Bryan Park, some of which were blocking the sidewalks and paths through the park, some of which were leaning against trees and benches, all of which were eyesores in an otherwise lovely park. At one point in the afternoon, six or so Lime scooters were dropped off on the sidewalk by the Henderson St. lower parking lot by folks from Enterprise Rental, on the sidewalk, where people walk, run, etc.

In Bloomington, we are fortunate to have bike racks everywhere. Would it be possible to require that users and companies place the scooters at bike rack locations? By simply allowing them to be left wherever, users are leaving them around without regard to others. 

This is also a bit of an issue with the Pace bikes. A few weeks ago, one was left leaning on the stop sign at Henderson and Davis, when there is a bike rack just a block away in the park. 

Thank you for taking steps to regulate these companies in a manner that benefits everyone.

I have seen this particular vehicle parked on the path a number of times since the house was built adjacent to the path.  Considering your suggestion from the previous incident, I have attached a photo of the offending vehicle.  From the license plate, the operator appears to be connected with law enforcement (license plate LE8928).  I find this very disturbing that an individual who should be setting an example for the community is using a pedestrian path for convenience.  I would like to point out that I occasionally ride my bicycle on this path and have observed pedestrians on it as well.  Also, there is plenty of street parking in this part of the neighborhood in front of the houses, i.e., I don't see lack of available parking as an excuse.
