The side walk in front of the house is all chewed up but my main concern is that the Jordan River surfaces right there on the east border of the house and the one next door. there is a broken railing there that is intended I suppose to protect someone from falling in. It is rusted thru and presents a dangerous situation for a child who could be walking there. Also the interior of that waterway canal has tons of trees growing in it that I think should be cut out, but believe that would be the city's property there to take care of. Any way the two issues make that a dangerous spot.

I see children walking down this street every day to access the playgrounds and it is undeniably an unsafe street given that cars are parked on both sides and traffic is traveling both ways.

Dunn Street is narrow, with low visibility hampered by hills, and College Avenue has high-speed traffic. Bloomington Mass Transit does not serve our neighborhood. These factors combine to make walking or biking into or out of Blue Ridge a challenge. It would be of great benefit to our neighborhood if some means could be found to connect our neighborhood via sidewalks to the rest of Bloomington and give our 220 households a means to safely access Bloomington other than by car.

With that goal in mind, we request consideration of a sidewalk on North Dunn Street connecting SR 45/46 to Tamarack and ultimately Lakewood Drive.

Usually I scurry quickly up that street as I'm running late; sometimes I jog.  But once I get to the part of Woodlawn that borders Bryan Park, I am loathe to get myself onto the park trail during my hasty commute for a few reasons:

1. The Bryan Park trail is a park trail, not a sidewalk.

2. This trail doesn't go straight northward, so it is a waste of my time to follow it.

3. My commute is at 7:15am when few people are out, making things unnecessarily scary for trail users when I'm quickly approaching them from behind.  This is especially true during colder months when it is dark out, and also when I'm carrying my umbrella, which looks not unlike some sort of a weapon.  (Its just an Ikea umbrella.)

This morning I was yelled at for the second time by another motorist who was displeased with my choosing to walk on Woodlawn Avenue northbound past Bryan Park.  ""There's a sidewalk over there!"" he shouted.  I had wanted to correct him and point out that its a park trail, but I didn't.  Who knows which maniac who shouts at pedestrians from their car isn't more dangerous, you know?

It would be great if there were a sidewalk that ran alongside Woodlawn Avenue past Bryan Park.  I'm not the only person who chooses to walk up the road instead of the park trail, but I admit that there are not many of us, at least at 7:15am.

Let me end by saying that I am not holding out hope for a sidewalk; this probably isn't a great concern for the city.  But I can't guarantee that annoyed motorists will convince me to change my path, either.

In any case: thank you for reading and considering my request.  Have a nice day.

Essentially, we wanted to get in contact with the city regarding the parking out front of our building during late night hours (11pm-3am). Our hope is that we could put in a request to have those spots blocked off during those times during the school semesters. The reason for this is due to safety. With more and more students being picked up and dropped off at the location by ubers, lyfts, etc, cars are constantly coming and going from the location. Our main concern is that when cars are parked in these spots, students attempting to cross the street or make their way to their respective rides are difficult to see for oncoming traffic. If this is at all possible on a semi-permanent basis going forward or even only for temporary large events such as the Little 500 weekend, please contact me at the email listed above and let me know what we need to do in order to make this happen, if possible.

I would like to suggest a sidewalk due to a safety concern that effects children and disabled persons. Referring to the intersection at E Rogers Road and the Stands Drive. There is no sidewalk along this street connecting the stands road sidewalk to the crosswalk at the roundabout at the bottom of the hill (i.e., the area on the south side of E Rogers Road). Moreover, the sidewalk on the other side of the street is completely inaccessible for those with impaired motor function or wheelchairs (there is a large hill with steps only and no ramp). There are two major concerns here: (1) there is no possible way for a disabled person with a wheelchair to travel on E Rogers road (from the roundabout at the bottom of the hill up to the stands drive). (2) There is no way for families and children to safely walk to Child's elementary from this location (the Stands dr). Given that E Rogers road is a busy street with limited visibility for drivers and no crosswalk exists at the intersection of  the Stands drive and E Rogers Road, it is extremely dangerous for children and families that wish to walk their children to the designated elementary school - Child's Elementary. This is the only direct walking path to Child's Elementary for all of the constituents that leave in the Stands neighborhood. There is no sidewalk on the south side of E Rogers Rd to connect the Stands Dr with the crosswalk at the bottom of the hill at the roundabout. Several constituents have expressed a safety concern.
