This 200 yards' block is the ""missing link"" between the Southern Pines neighborhood (which
has a decent sidewalk network) and the Country View apartment complex, which has the closest city bus stop.

On this block of Rockport Rd, if one is to walk north from W Pinehurst Dr along the west side of Rockport, the sidewalk simply ends in a fence (pictured in the photo attached). I pass there often, and I've seen pedestrians use the road shoulder, which is quite dangerous, what with the narrow street, heavy traffic, and limited visibility (hills). On the east side
of Rockport Rd, there is sidewalk part of the way, but it is not continuous either; besides, crossing the road twice may be dangerous, especially for older people and children, considering what the traffic
and visibility in Rocport Rd is like.

I think it would be highly useful for many residents (and for people who have to drive through there) if some kind of improvement project were undertaken. One ought to either build a sidewalk along the west side of the road, or to complete the sidewalk along the east side and create marked pedestrian crossings at W. Graham and W. Pinehurst (or

Plus, Rockport is becoming a rather busy road, with many cars constantly rushing by at a rather fast speed.

What you have to do is use the sidewalk across the street (which does have a curb cut) and then cross Clarizz to enter the Bloomingfoods parking area. The problem with this is that the traffic is very heavy on Clarizz, particularly so close to the intersection with 3rd St and this makes crossing, particularly for someone in a wheelchair, perilous.

Yesterday (Tuesday, June 28, 2016) a new sidewalk was built next door at 1119 N. Lincoln Street. The left over concrete was dumped in the tree plot at the southeast corner of my lot at 1125 N. Lincoln Street.

I would appreciate it if you could see that this problem is corrected.

Thank you,

I am writing to report an issue with water drainage coming from the roofs of houses and dumping on to the sidewalk. Along N. Indiana Ave, many houses/apartments (owned by Elkins Apartments) have drainage downspouts that empty directly on to the sidewalk. This creates a hazard with constant freeze and thew during the winter months. I have personally felt unsafe walking down a sloped sidewalk, on what is pure ice during periods this winter. Indiana Ave. is a very high foot traffic area during winter months as fans walk to and from basketball games. From witnessing several people slip and fall on the ice, I feel like it is my duty as a citizen to report this issue to the city. Though we have been blessed this season with relatively mild temperatures, this does not overshadow the safety hazard created from the downspouts off many of these houses.

The tree is close the curb next to the street and I was told by a landscaping company, it was probably most likely owned by the city of Bloomington. It has lifted our sidewalk significantly as well as part of our driveway. This is a liability issue because many children ride bikes, scooters,sevreal people walk their dogs etc around there and could easily not pay attention and trip and fall. Someone from this department really needs to come out and assess the situation. You are welcome to call me or email. Thank you. Jane Mehrizi","Street Department",,Bloomington,IN,,,

Unfortunately I've been experiencing some drainage issues at my corner since the installation of a wheelchair ramp for the sidewalk.  There was no issue prior.  Terrific having the ramp for folks, plus the earlier sidewalk, but unfortunately it has no lip on it at all.  As you can see in the photo, the street is essentially level with part of my yard now, allowing even the smallest rain to flood the corner.  I'd love to grow grass but am having difficulties because of the situation.  There was grass prior, but someone crashed into the streetlamp, and when it was replaced, the ground got torn up a bit.  Beyond my yard, a small pool exists along the corner until it dries out as well, as it is unable to pass on through.  Also sediment as you can see in the photo (taken tonight a few hours after the end of today's misting) is washed into the street with each rain.  Please see if there can be just the smallest bit of lip and/or incline added with the ramp/sidewalk to keep the water moving instead of creating a muddy corner.  Thank you for any help!  (Or ideas!)  Any chance you all might have a square foot of sod that is fairly water tolerant that can just be placed down there?  Might solve my issue without any need for changing anything with the concrete assuming it takes root.  I appreciate the consideration and help.  There is also a bus stop right at the corner, so more than just helping me, it keeps the bus waiters from standing in the mud.","Planning and Transportation",,Bloomington,IN,,,

In spring of 2017 I filed a report with the city about the downspout drainage from my neighbor's property (2802 S Forrester), which dispenses rainwater directly onto the sidewalk in front of my house. They were issued a notice by the city, and they cut back the relevant downspout as indicated in the resolution of the ticket.

However, thereafter they built a masonry channel from the end of the downspout that continues to direct the rainwater from the downspout onto the sidewalk in front of my property. When it rains moderately or heavily, the sidewalk on my property turns into a river, still, and in the seasonal transition to and from winter, the sidewalk winds up coated with ice. They
masonry channel is topped with a plywood cover that is disguised with landscape rocks.

I wanted to talk with them about this directly rather than file a report, but for 3 weeks I have not seen them at their house. Their house is reportedly under contract for sale, and I think it only fair that this issue be resolved (ideally by extending the drainage under the sidewalk to the curb so it no longer causes a negative impact on my property) before they sell it, so that new owners do not have to correct something they are not responsible for.

This is a follow up to ticket #166390, in which Phil Peden indicated he wanted to see it when it rains. This is a view to the west from the sidewalk on the west side of Rogers St at about 9th street, between Bloomington Iron Metal (right of photo) and 501 N Rogers. The two problematic tributaries are labelled in the photo. They meet just to the left of the photo, which is exactly where the sidewalk crosses the 501 N Rogers driveway, and they flow south from there. Tributary A runs eastward along the north side of the pavement there, and then fans out where the pavement seam starts, and poses the larger problem because it is too wide to step over. Tributary B handles a large volume of water, but in light rain you can hop over it onto a manhole cover (marked ""communications"") that is just to the right of the photo. If a trench was dug in the dirt along the north side of the asphalt, extending all the way from the fence to the sidewalk, then A and B could probably be forced to join directly at the photographer's feet. Then it is just a matter of digging a trench under the sidewalk to the existing (and dry) rain gutter just behind the photographer.

I ride the bus to work at the Gov. Agency building at 1531 S.

The area is super muddy, and even someone with good balance like me can't walk through it.  There is a sidewalk leading through the parking lot, but where the bus drops you off there is no actual sidewalk, and the bus won't drop someone off at the actual sidewalk due to it obstructing the parking lot entrance.  All it would take is probably about 20-30 feet of sidewalk right there.  There may already be a number of complaints, but I really hope it gets fixed so someone doesn't flip their wheelchair into the road or something.

If I develop any issues because of your departments failure to maintain the sidewalk, or your failure to enforce sidewalk repairs, I will be sending the City a bill.","Street Department","1001-1023 E 7th St, Bloomington, Indiana, 47405",Bloomington,IN,,39.16931533813477,-86.52111053466797

But I’m now tackling a problem related to the substantial growth in tourism. It initially seemed reasonable to allow tour busses to park on city street in front of hotels, but there a too many days where half of the available parking on the block is taken by busses. Some days,like today, it’s 100% bus parking g without a single parking space available for a visiting family or business guest in the hotel or even a customer for a downtown shop. 
This isn’t normal parking management. It’s not good parking management.
The busses should be parked in a large lot like the convention center or Assembly Hall (IU groups)
I have helped manage a lot of downtown growth issues and this one looks to be easily fixable. 
Thanks for any help
